-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a list of known bugs, requested features, and potential improvements.
Not everything here will necessarily be addressed. If you make any improvements
to the bot, feel free to share patches with me by emailing them to cjones@insub.org.

In no particular order..

FIXME: (blatant bugs, broken stuff)
XXX: (known shortcomings)

*** config-related

- db files really need the option of giving them a namespace. right now any bots run
  from the same directory will share the same datafiles. while DB4 makes this *safe* to
  do, it's not very useful for having bots on different networks/channels.

- ability to explicitly disable modules from config

*** irc module

- identify with nickserv in irc module (need to test various protocols :/)
- channel or server passwords in irc module

*** modules

- change urban/bbcnew/dictionary match syntax for defintion number. can't look up "area 52" e.g.
- grufti module *needs* boundary checking so substrings don't trigger
- factoids and grufti *always* trigger, which is annoying sometimes. when addressed they should always trigger,
  but when not addressed, only triggering n% of the time would be ideal. or not at all. should be configurable
- priority on modules and/or short-circuiting to prevent match chaining spam
- memebot is missing some features from the original: ability to request a specific score, ability to ignore
  certain urls, the web backend (need to decide on django or turbogears..)
- logging module?
- consider some higher level admin duties such as auto-opping/kickban/etc. eggdrop module? would be nice to
  obsolete having multiple bots, although eggdrops are largely replaced by chanserv/nickserv

*** base class

- add some verbosity. right now you don't know what's going on until it gets in channel
- too many modules sitting in the include directory because they aren't getting enough metadata from the bot
  controller. this is a case of too much abstraction. modules should have access to this data whether they
  decide to use it or not. the only thing that should be in the include directory are third party tools and the
  util.py module that has helper functions
- documentation on individual modules is lacking. they should be explained so users can enable/disable them
  in config without being assaulted by potentially offensive or spammy stuff when deployed

TODO: (feature requests)

- ignore list for other bots that might get in a spam war
- authentication for remote admin functions
- option to create a FIFO unix file that you can pipe to to fist madcow.. maybe
- chatroom support for aim/oscar module
- color support ported from insub.pl for higher levels of obnoxiousness
