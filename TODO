*** broken modules

- sing
- colors don't terminate properly

*** irc module

- identify with nickserv in irc module
- channel or server passwords in irc module

*** modules

- change urban/bbcnew/dictionary match syntax for defintion number.
  can't look up "area 52" e.g.
- factoids and grufti *always* trigger, which is annoying sometimes.
  when addressed they should always trigger, but when not addressed,
  only triggering n% of the time would be ideal. or not at all. should
  be configurable
- consider some higher level admin duties such as
  auto-opping/kickban/etc. eggdrop module? would be nice to obsolete
  having multiple bots, although eggdrops are largely replaced by
  chanserv/nickserv

TODO: (feature requests)

- authentication for remote admin functions
- option to create a FIFO unix file that you can pipe to to fist
  madcow.. maybe
- chatroom support for aim/oscar module
