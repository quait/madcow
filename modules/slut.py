"""
Slutcheck - Uses google "safesearch" to determine how "slutty" a word or
phrase is.  (To get an accurate slut rating for a phrase it should be
quoted.)

Uses the ratio of hits doing an unsafe search to the number of hits
doing a safe search to determine the score.  If a safe search returns 0
results, and unsafe returns, say, 100, the phrase is 100% slutty.  If
the number of results for both are equal, the phrase is 0% slutty.
