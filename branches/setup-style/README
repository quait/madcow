REQUIREMENTS

    * python 2.6 or higher

    SILC: pysilc-0.5/silc-toolkit-1.1.8 -- Other versions may not work!


BASIC USAGE

    $ madcow [-b <dirname>]

    This will create a new bot in ~/.madcow unless changed with the -b
    option. Go into here and edit settings.py and rerun the bot.

    In IRC, message the bot with 'help' to see a list of commands. To
    trigger him publicly, most commands require that you address the
    bot, for example:

        <cj_> madcow: wiki dinosaurs
        <madcow> Dinosaur - Dinosaurs were the dominant vertebrate
                 animals of terrestrial ecosystems for over 160 million
                 years, from the late Triassic period to the end of the
                 Cretaceous period, when most of them became extinct in
                 the CretaceousTertiary extinction event.

    *** WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! ***

    Most modules are disabled by default. Please look through the
    modules section of settings.py to customize your bot. SOME MODULES
    PRODUCE POTENTIALLY OFFENSIVE MATERIAL OR ARE "SPAMMY". If you are
    using your bot in a serious context (such as a work IRC server) or a
    channel with people who are irritated by chatty bots, please keep
    this in mind before bringing Madcow online. I completely disclaim
    ANY responsibility for trouble you might get yourself in as a result
    of taking this bot online without testing it first!  However, if you
    are in a channel that embraces obnoxious behavior (or at least
    tolerates it), also see my Irssi plugin gay.pl (named insub.pl in
    MacPorts and FreeBSD Ports) at:
    http://gruntle.org/projects/irssi/gay/.


SLIGHTLY MORE ADVANCED USAGE

    If "NOBOT" (without the quotes) appears anywhere in a line, Madcow
    will pretend it didn't see it. This means it won't log URLs, log
    the line to the public chat file (if enabled), or respond to it in
    any way. This is useful if you wish to keep something private such
    as the url to naked pictures of yourself.

    If a command begins with ^, it will colorize the output in rainbow
    pattern.


AUTO-OPS / ADMIN

    In settings.py, set owner name to your IRC nick. Message bot with
    'admin register <password>'. This will register you as an admin.
    Other users may now register, and you can give them auto-op flag
    with /msg madcow admin chflag <user> +o. You can also set the
    default flags in madcow.ini to give any user that registers
    auto-ops.

    If you wish to batch-add users for auto-op access without them
    registering, edit data/db-madcow-passwd and add a line for each
    user:

    nick:*:o

    Note they will not be able to login in this case.
