REQUIREMENTS

    * python 2.6 or higher

    SILC: pysilc-0.5/silc-toolkit-1.1.8 -- Other versions may not work!


INSTALLATION

    $ python setup.py build
    $ sudo python setup.py install


RUNNING THE BOT

    $ madcow [-b <dirname>]

    This will create a new bot in ~/.madcow unless changed with the -b
    option. Go into here and edit settings.py and rerun the bot.


USING IT THE OLD WAY

    If you want to use it the old way (one big dir, no installation) you
    can do so like this:

    $ mv scripts/madcow madcow.py
    $ ./madcow.py -b .


MIGRATING FROM 1.x

    If you are using a 1.x version of the bot, you can use the migration
    script in contrib/ to migrate the datafiles/logs into the new format.

    $ ./contrib/migrate_madcow_1to2.py /path/to/old/madcow ~/.madcow


BASIC USAGE:

    In IRC, message the bot with 'help' to see a list of commands. To
    trigger him publicly, most commands require that you address the
    bot, for example:

        <cj_> madcow: wiki dinosaurs
        <madcow> Dinosaur - Dinosaurs were the dominant vertebrate
                 animals of terrestrial ecosystems for over 160 million
                 years, from the late Triassic period to the end of the
                 Cretaceous period, when most of them became extinct in
                 the CretaceousTertiary extinction event.

    *** WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! ***

    Most modules are disabled by default. Please look through the
    modules section of settings.py to customize your bot. SOME MODULES
    PRODUCE POTENTIALLY OFFENSIVE MATERIAL OR ARE "SPAMMY". If you are
    using your bot in a serious context (such as a work IRC server) or a
    channel with people who are irritated by chatty bots, please keep
    this in mind before bringing Madcow online. I completely disclaim
    ANY responsibility for trouble you might get yourself in as a result
    of taking this bot online without testing it first!


SLIGHTLY MORE ADVANCED USAGE

    If "NOBOT" (without the quotes) appears anywhere in a line, Madcow
    will pretend it didn't see it. This means it won't log URLs, log
    the line to the public chat file (if enabled), or respond to it in
    any way. This is useful if you wish to keep something private such
    as the url to naked pictures of yourself.

    If a command begins with ^, it will colorize the output in rainbow
    pattern.


AUTO-OPS / ADMIN

    In settings.py, set owner name to your IRC nick. Message bot with
    'admin register <password>'. This will register you as an admin.
    Other users may now register, and you can give them auto-op flag
    with /msg madcow admin chflag <user> +o. You can also set the
    default flags in madcow.ini to give any user that registers
    auto-ops.

    If you wish to batch-add users for auto-op access without them
    registering, edit db/passwd and add a line for each user:

    nick:*:o

    Note they will not be able to login in this case.


TWITTER

    Set up a twitter account and follow the people you want to see
    updates from. Then run the contrib/get_twiter_auth_keys.py script
    and follow the directions. At the end of the process you should
    have 4 settings you can copy-paste into your settings.py. Be sure
    to delete the settings already there, or paste at the bottom.
