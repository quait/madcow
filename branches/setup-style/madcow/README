REQUIREMENTS

    * python 2.5 or higher

    Madcow can use a variety of protocol formats.  Depending on which
    you choose, you may need a third-party library to handle the
    protocol.

    IRC, AIM, and CLI: no modules needed
    SILC: pysilc-0.5/silc-toolkit-1.1.8 -- Other versions may not work!

    Madcow also comes with a suite of plugins that provide
    functionality.  Most of these use the core Python library, however
    a few need third-party libraries.  If a plugin does not have the
    required components it will be disabled at runtime.  You can find a
    description of each plugin in madcow.ini-sample

    memebot.py: sqlobject, pysqlite or MySQLdb


BASIC USAGE

    Copy madcow.ini-sample to madcow.ini, edit options, and run:

    $ python madcow.py

    In IRC, message the bot with 'help' to see a list of commands. To
    trigger him publicly, most commands require that you address the
    bot, for example:

        <cj_> madcow: wiki dinosaurs
        <madcow> Dinosaur - Dinosaurs were the dominant vertebrate
                 animals of terrestrial ecosystems for over 160 million
                 years, from the late Triassic period to the end of the
                 Cretaceous period, when most of them became extinct in
                 the CretaceousTertiary extinction event.

    By default, madcow runs as a commandline tool which does NOT
    require addressing. Change the protocol to irc in madcow.ini (and
    edit the connection options in [irc]) to connect to IRC.  You may
    override the protocol by passing the -p <proto> option.

    *** WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! ***

    Most modules are disabled by default.  Please look through the
    [modules] section of madcow.ini to customize your bot.  SOME
    MODULES PRODUCE POTENTIALLY OFFENSIVE MATERIAL OR ARE "SPAMMY".  If
    you are using your bot in a serious context (such as a work IRC
    server) or a channel with people who are irritated by chatty bots,
    please keep this in mind before bringing Madcow online.  I
    completely disclaim ANY responsibility for trouble you might get
    yourself in as a result of taking this bot online without testing
    it first!  However, if you are in a channel that embraces obnoxious
    behavior (or at least tolerates it), also see my Irssi plugin
    gay.pl (named insub.pl in MacPorts and FreeBSD Ports) at:
    http://gruntle.org/projects/irssi/gay/.


SLIGHTLY MORE ADVANCED USAGE

    If "NOBOT" (without the quotes) appears anywhere in a line, Madcow
    will pretend it didn't see it.  This means it won't log URLs, log
    the line to the public chat file (if enabled), or respond to it in
    any way.  This is useful if you wish to keep something private such
    as the url to naked pictures of yourself.

    If a command begins with ^, it will colorize the output in rainbow
    pattern.


AUTO-OPS / ADMIN

    In madcow.ini, set owner name to your IRC nick. Message bot with
    'admin register <password>'. This will register you as an admin.
    Other users may now register, and you can give them auto-op flag
    with /msg madcow admin chflag <user> +o. You can also set the
    default flags in madcow.ini to give any user that registers
    auto-ops.

    If you wish to batch-add users for auto-op access without them
    registering, edit data/db-madcow-passwd and add a line for each
    user:

    nick:*:o

    Note they will not be able to login in this case.


ADVANCED USAGE

    By default, the bot will use IRC. If you wish to use SILC or AIM,
    uncomment the appropriate line in madcow.ini. You can also specify
    a config file to use on the command line (./madcow.py --help for
    full list of options).

    If you use this script to run multiple bots, you may wish to change
    the "dbNamespace" directive in config. This will keep your database
    files separate for each bot. If you do not change this, they will
    share the same data.

    If you wish to test the bots behavior before deploying, run:

    $ ./madcow.py -p cli

    NOTE: When deployed in a public chat channel (such as IRC or SILC),
    the bot will only respond to most queries when it is addressed.
    This consists of appending the bot's given nickname in the
    commandline.  For example:

    madcow: quote aapl
    madcow - translate from english to german: this beer is really good

    If you wish to enable the "grufti response" module, you must copy
    grufti-responses.txt-sample to grufti-responses.txt.  This is a
    database of hard-coded match/response directives. It will choose a
    random reply whenever it sees a match. It does not need to be
    addressed.  By default the matchfile comes with a set of Zippy and
    Simpsons quotes.  You can delete these and add your own if you
    wish, or just symlink the provided response file.  See
    README.grufti for more detail on the syntax and advanced features.

MEGAHAL

    MegaHAL is a markov chain bot.  If you enable the module for this,
    you will need to compile the C extension.  To do this:

    $ cd <madcow>/include/pymegahal
    $ ./build.py

    This will automatically build megahal.so and install it into your
    include directory, assuming it compiles cleanly on your platform.


WRITING EXTENSIONS

    In the modules/ dir, copy template.py to your new module.  Edit the
    various options in the MatchObject() class and make the response()
    function return desired output.  See existing modules for example
    usage. The file must end in .py and exist in the modules
    subdirectory to load.

    If you write something cool and want to share, send it to
    cjones@gruntle.org.


WRITING OUTPUT PLUGINS

    If you wish to write support for a different protocol, this is done
    by making a new file with the name of the protocol you wish to
    support inside the protocols directory, and giving it a class
    called OutputHandler.  It *must* subclass madcow.MadCow.

    The new class must have a start() method defined and the __init__
    method must accept certain parameters. Please see existing
    protocols for an example.  Currently we have: cli.py, irc.py,
    silc.py and aim.py.

    If you are developing for a new protocol you may request assistance
    from me at cjones@insub.org.


WRITING PLUGINS THAT RUN PERIODICALLY

    You can write a module that, instead of being triggered by chatter
    in channel, is invoked on a schedule. For example, if you want a
    module that checks a website every 5 minutes for an update then
    notifies the channel. These go in the 'periodic' directory, and you
    should use the template.py in that directory. The process()
    function of the PeriodicEvent class should return a string or None
    (for no response).
