    * memebot url catcher now sees and records commentary that goes with a
    posted link, such as surrounding text.
    * memebot frontend search now matches "comments"
    * IRC, CLI, and SILC now can colorize output. appending a string with
    ^ will cause its output to use a random rainbow color.
    * new -- jinx.py. sort of self-explanatory, catches people who say the
    same thing simultaneously.
    * grufti module can now have inline tokens which will choose a random
    word/phrase from a list.

    most ascii art to the RFC limit.
    * rainbow offset will now properly roll over instead of growing
    infinitely

    protocol-depending required variables and passing around a Request
    object which can have arbitrary attributes. These are made available
    to the plugin modules as a dict, allowing for more advanced
    protocol-dependent modules. This also allows pre-/post-processing
    filters to be applied within the protocol module.
