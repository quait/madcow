*** general

- improve anti-abuse settings.. need to keep track of global module
  invocations and throttle people who spam the bot.  Right now, a malicious
  user can use the bot to DDOS various websites, burn all cpu/bandwidth on
  the machine, or just annoy people in general.

  * problem:  where to throttle?  we can only deign to care about what
    the user is doing *if* they trigger something, but this can happen
    inside of threads or serial code.  There's really no entirely safe
    global place to handle this....  hurr.

- support postgres!
