No one can stop you / you wanna be there in their smile / no way you can forget it / corroded feelings, fire in your heart.
Pierce into the storm / there's fear in the answers / hearing a faint voice from the past / memories of pain.
An evil force it's corroding all your actions / There's no hope it's reflected in blood shoot eyes.
Another crime, another passion / innocence doesn't fit blazes, ash inhalation / the worst burn is yet to come.
Blazes rise your world's insane / deep inside your heart is still the pain pain that drives you in to this hell / a sweet course eating you away.
Let him burn! / I hear his crying / I see his body turning to ashes.

If they ever come up with a swashbuckling School, I think one of the courses should be Laughing, Then Jumping Off Something.
When you're riding in a time machine way far into the future, don't stick your elbow out the window, or it'll turn into a fossil.
It takes a big man to cry, but it takes a bigger man to laugh at that man.
At first I thought, if I were Superman, a perfect secret identity would be "Clark Kent, Dentist," because you could save money on tooth X-rays. But then I thought, if a patient said, "How's my back tooth?" and you just looked at it with your X-ray vision and said, "Oh it's okay," then the patient would probably say, "Aren't you going to take an X-ray, stupid?" and you'd say, "Aw fuck you, get outta here," and then he probably wouldn't even pay his bill.
One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to take my little nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old burned-out warehouse. "Oh, no," I said. "Disneyland burned down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down, he thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the real Disneyland, but it was getting pretty late.
A good way to threaten somebody is to light a stick of dynamite. Then you call the guy and hold the burning fuse up to the phone. "Hear that?" you say. "That's dynamite, baby."
Why do people in ship mutinies always ask for "better treatment"? I'd ask for a pinball machine, because with all that rocking back and forth you'd probably be able to get a lot of free games.
I'd like to be buried Indian-style, where they put you up on a high rack, above the ground. That way, you could get hit by meteorites and not even feel it.
If I lived back in the wild west days, instead of carrying a six-gun in my holster, I'd carry a soldering iron. That way, if some smart-aleck cowboy said something like "Hey, look. He's carrying a soldering iron!" and started laughing, and everybody else started laughing, I could just say, "That's right, it's a soldering iron. The soldering iron of justice." Then everybody would get real quiet and ashamed, because they had made fun of the soldering iron of justice, and I
I bet when the neanderthal kids would make a snowman, someone would always end up saying, "Don't forget the thick, heavy brows." Then they would all get embarrassed because they remembered they had the big hunky brows too, and they'd get mad and eat the snowman.
Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let's say you're an astronaught on the moon and you fear that your partner has been turned into Dracula. The next time he goes out for the moon pieces, wham!, you just slam the door behind him and blast off. He might call you on the radio and say he's not Dracula, but you just say, "Think again, bat man."
Too bad you can't buy a voodoo globe so that you could make the earth spin real fast and freak everybody out.
The people in the village were real poor, so none of the children had any toys. But this one little boy had otten an old enema bag and filled it with rocks, and he would go around and whap the other children across the facaddrespline jack I bet the main reason the police keep people away from a plane crash is they don't want anybody walking in and lying down in the crash stuff, then, when somebody comes up, act like they just woke up and go, "What was THAT?!"
The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of the face.
Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus Flytrap. The flytrap can bite and bite, but it won't bother the frog because it only has little tiny plant teeth. But some other stuff could happen and it could be like ambition.
I'd rather be rich than stupid.
If you were a poor Indian with no weapons, and a bunch of conquistadors came up to you and asked where the gold was, I don't think it would be a good idea to say, "I swallowed it. So sue me."
If you define cowardice as running away at the first sign of danger, screaming and tripping and begging for mercy, then yes, Mr. Brave man, I guess I'm a coward.
I bet one legend that keeps recurring throughout history, in every culture, is the story of Popeye.
When you go in for a job interview, I think a good thing to ask is if they ever press charges.
To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.
What is it that makes a complete stranger dive into an icy river to save a solid gold baby? Maybe we'll never know.
We tend to scoff at the beliefs of the ancients. But we can't scoff at them personally, to their faces, and this is what annoys me.
Probably the earliest flyswatters were nothing more than some sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.
I think someone should have had the decency to tell me the luncheon was free. To make someone run out with potato salad in his hand, pretending he's throwing up, is not what I call hospitality.
To me, clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kind of scary. I've wondered where this started and I think it goes back to the time I went to the circus, and a clown killed my dad.
As I bit into the nectarine, it had a crisp juiciness about it that was very pleasurable - until I realized it wasn't a nectarine at all, but A HUMAN HEAD!!
Most people don't realize that large pieces of coral, which have been painted brown and attached to the skull by common wood screws, can make a child look like a deer.
If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.
Better not take a dog on the space shuttle, because if he sticks his head out when you're coming home his face might burn up.
You know what would make a good story? Something about a clown who make people happy, but inside he's real sad. Also, he has severe diarrhea.
Sometimes when I feel like killing someone, I do a little trick to calm myself down. I'll go over to the persons house and ring the doorbell. When the person comes to the door, I'm gone, but you know what I've left on the porch? A jack-o-lantern with a knife stuck addrespline jack If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you because, hey, free dummy.
I'd like to see a nude opera, because when they hit those high notes, I bet you can really see it in those genitals.
Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto someones neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I have to laugh, because what is that thing.
He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land. He loved it so much he made a woman out of dirt and married her. But when he kissed her, she disintegrated. Later, at the funeral, when the preacher said, "Dust to dust," some people laughed, and the cowboy shot them. At his hanging, he told the others, "I'll be waiting for you in heaven--with a gun."
The memories of my family outings are still a source of strength to me. I remember we'd all pile into the car - I forget what kind it was - and drive and drive. I'm not sure where we'd go, but I think there were some trees there. The smell of something was strong in the air as we played whatever sport we played. I remember a bigger, older guy we called "Dad." We'd eat some stuff, or not, and then I think we went home. I guess some things never leave you.
If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him is "God is crying." And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing to tell him is "Probaddrespline jack Contrary to what most people say, the most dangerous animal in the world is not the lion or the tiger or even the elephant. It's a shark riding on an elephant's back, just trampling and eating everything they see.
As we were driving, we saw a sign that said "Watch for Rocks." Marta said it should read "Watch for Pretty Rocks." I told her she should write in her suggestion to the highway department, but she started saying it was a joke - just to get out of writing a simple letter! And I thought I was lazy!
One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to take my little nephew to DisneyLand, but instead I drove him to an old burned-out warehouse. "Oh, no," I said, "DisneyLand burned down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down he thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the real DisneyLand, but it was getting pretty late.
If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you think likeaddrespline jack I wish a robot would get elected president. That way, when he came to town, we could all take a shot at him and not feel too bad.
As the evening sky faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint gray, I thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how gray he was, and how I named him Flint.
If you're a young Mafia gangster out on your first date, I bet it's real embarrassing if someone tries to kill you.
Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what is I was an ant, and she fell on me. Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.
If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and you friends are all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be to pretend you were swimming.
When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman. After school we'd all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he would eat one of us. It wasn'taddrespline jack Children need encouragement. If a kid gets an answer right, tell him it was a lucky guess. That way he develops a good, lucky feeling.
The crows seemed to be calling his name, thought Caw.
When you die, if you get a choice between going to regular heaven or pie heaven, choose pie heaven. It might be a trick, but if it's not, mmmmmmm, boy.
Whether they find a life there or not, I think Jupiter should be called an enemy planet.
Instead of trying to build newer and bigger weapons of destruction, we should be thinking about getting more use out of the ones we already have.
I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate revolver. and since he is so busy, you'd probably have to run up to him real quick and give it to him.
Just because swans mate for life, I don't think its that big a deal. First of all, if you're a swan, you're probably not going to find a swan that looks much better thaddrespline jack Too bad when I was a kid there wasn't a guy in our class that everybody called the "Cricket Boy", because I would have liked to stand up in class and tell everybody, "You can make fun of the Cricket Boy if you want to, but to me he's just like everybody else." Then everybody would leave the
I think a good product would be "Baby Duck Hat". It's a fake baby duck, which you strap on top of your head. Then you go swimming underwater until you find a mommy duck and her babies, and you join them. Then, all of a sudden, you stand up out of the water and roar like Godzilla. Man, those ducks really take off! Also, Baby Duck Hat is good for parties.
I wish I lived back in the old west days, because I'd save up my money addrespline jack A funny thing to do is, if you're out hiking and your friend gets bitten by a poisonous snake, tell him you're going to go for help, then go about ten feet and pretend that *you* got bit by a snake. Then start an argument with him about who's going to go get help. A lot of guys will start crying. That's why it makes you feel good when you tell them it was just a joke.
I guess I kinda lost control, because in the middle of the play I ran up and lit the evil puppet villain on fire. No, I didn't. Just kidding. I just said that to help illustrate one of the human emotions, which is freaking out. Another emotion is greed, as when you kill someone for money, or something like that. Another emotion is generosity, as when you pay someone double what he paid for his stupid puppet.
Many people think that history is a dull subject. Dull? Is it "dull" that Jesse James once got bitten on the forehead by an ant, and at first it didn't seem like anything, but then the bitaddrespline jack I scrambled to the top of the precipice where Nick was waiting. "That was fun," I said. "You bet it was," said Nick. "Let's climb higher." "No," I said. "I think we should be heading back now." "We have time," Nick insisted. I said we didn't, and Nick said we did. We ar
If you're a Thanksgiving dinner, but you don't like the stuffing or the cranberry sauce or anything else, just pretend like you're eating it, but instead, put it all in your lap and form it into a big mushy ball. Then, later, when you're out back having cigars with the boys, let out a big fake cough and throw the ball to the ground. Then say, "Boy, these are good cigars!"
I remember that one fateful day when Coach took me aside. I knew what was coming. "You don't have to tell me," I said. "I'm off the team, aren't I?" "Well," said Coach, "you never were really ON the team. You made that uniform you're wearing out of rags and towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet. You show up at practice and then either steal the ball and make us chase you to get it back, or you try to tackle people at inappropriate times." It was all true what he
If I ever opened a trampoline store, I don't think I'd call it Trampo-Land, because you might think it was a store for tramps, which is not the inpression we are trying to convey with our store. On the other hand, we would not prohibit tramps from browsing, or testing the trampolines, unless a tramp's gyrations seemed to be getting out of control.
I can still recall old Mister Barnslow getting out every morning and nailing a fresh load of tadpoles to the old board of his. Then he'd spin it round and round, like a wheel of fortune, and no matter where it stopped he'd yell out, "Tadpoles! Tadpoles is a winner!" We all thought he was crazy. But then we had some growing up to do.
Once when I was in Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, I met a mysterious old stranger. He said he was about to die and wanted to tell someone about the treasure. I said, "Okay, as long as it's not a long story. Some of us have a plane to catch, you know." He stared telling hes story, about the treasure and his life and all, and I thought: "This story isn't too long." But then, he kept going, and I started thinking, "Uh-oh, this story is getting long." But then the story was
I bet a fun thing would be to go way back in time to where there was going to be an eclipse and tell the cave men, "If I have come to destroy you, may the sun be blotted out from the sky." Just then the eclipse would start, and they'd probably try to kill you or something, but then you could explain about the rotation of the moon and all, and everyone would get a good laugh.
I wouldn't be surprised if someday some fishermen caught a big shark and cut it open, and there inside was a whole person. Then they cut the person open, and in him is a little baby shark. And in the baby shark there isn't a person, because it would be too small. But there's a little doll or something, like a Johnny Combat little toy guy---something like that.

This is Thanksgiving, so glue friendly or I'll take your glue away and no one will have any glue to glue with.
Wow, did you see that thing Marge? So powerful, so commanding, so forceful and raw. It didn't ask, it just took.
When will Detriot build a sunroof for the husky gentleman?
I don't want to pay four bucks to watch some monkey wannabe lay in the sun.
I'd like to read the following statement, but I do so under...my own free will. It has come to my attention that NBC sucks. I apologize for misleading you and urge you to watch as many FOX shows as possible. So in summary, NBC bad. FOX good. CBS great.
I've seen plays that were more exciting than this. Honest to God...plays.
Yep. So because of me, all the dorms now have security phones.
It's a pornography store. I was buying pornography.
Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.10/5/00
Just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time...like that day I hit the referee with a whiskey bottle.
I pity those fools on land, with their 'laws' and 'ethics.' They just can't appreciate the simple joys of a monkey knife fight.
To alcohol: the cause of and solution to all of life's problems.
See boy, the real money is in bootlegging, not your childish vandalism.
Asleep at the switch? I wasn't asleep, I was drunk!
Marge! Look at all this great stuff I found at the Marina. It was just sitting in some guy's boat!
So I said to him, 'Look, buddy, your car was upside down when we got here. And as for your Grandma, she shouldn't have mouthed off like that!'
The strong must protect the sweet.
I saw weird stuff in that place last night. Weird, strange, sick, twisted, eerie, godless, evil stuff! And I want in.
Yeah, hmm, let me have one of those porno magazines, large box of condoms, a bottle of Old Harper, couple of those panty shields, and some illegal fireworks, and one of those disposable enemas, ah, make it two.
All my life I've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body!
Now, Marge, just remember. If something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can't speak English. Ah, Tibor, how many times have you saved my butt?
Or what? You'll release the dogs, or the bees, or the dogs with bees in their mouths and when they bark they shoot bees at you? Well, go ahead -- do your worst!
OK Marge, if anyone asks, you require 24 hour nursing care, Lisa is a clergymen, Maggie is seven people, and Bart was wounded in Vietnam.
Dear baby, welcome to Dumpville , population you!
They didn't have any aspirin so I got you some cigarettes.
Homer no function beer well without.
Maybe it's the beer talking Marge but you got a butt that won't quit. they got those big chewy pretzels here merJanthfgrr five dollars??!!!?
Oh, wait a minute. Actually, a woman is more like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother to get one! [downs the beer] But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!
That's it! You people have stood in my way long enough. I'm going to clown college!
If you don't like your job, you don't strike: you just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way.
Your song touched me in a way I've never felt before. And which way to the can?
Remember when I got caught stealing all those watches from Sears? Well, that's nothing, because you have a gambling problem! And remember when I let that escaped lunatic in the house 'cause he was dressed like Santa Claus? Well you have a gambling problem!
Shut up, brain, or I'll stab you with a Q-tip!
All I'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That's it.
I've gone back to the time when dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos!
I am evil Homer! I am evil Homer! I am evil Homer! I am evil Homer!
Aah! Bogeyman! You nail the windows shut, I'll get the gun! Aarg! Bart, I don't want to alarm you, but there maybe a boogieman or boogimen in the house.
We got more gongs than the break-dancing robot that caught on fire.
Ah, finally a little quiet time to read some of my old favorites...honey-roasted peanuts. Ingredients: salt, artificial honey-roasting agents, pressed peanut sweepings...mmm.
Ah, the last peanut- overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed brothers.
Well, boy, you won. So I'm going to live up to my side of the agreement: here's your turtle, alive and well.
I asked for ketchup! I'm eating salad here.
Hey! Apu just called. This Friday, Lisa's team is playing Bart's team. You're in direct competition. And don't go easy on each other just because you're brother and sister. I want to see you both fighting for your parents' love!
I'm wizzing with the door open, and I love it.
No offense, Apu, but when they were handing our religions, you must have been out taking a wiz.
No, Lisa. The only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother! I call him Gamblor, and it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws!
Now, let's see. This will make three Christmas's I saved versus eight I ruined. Two were kind of a draw.
Hmm. I guess Bart's not to blame. Which is lucky, too, because it's spanking season, and I got a hankering for some spankering!
Blame me if you must, but don't ever speak ill of the Program! The Program is rock solid! The Program is sound!
Oh, How am I suposed to last 5 days without shooting something?
Dad, you and your stories. Bart broke my teeth. The nurses are stealing my money. This thing on my neck is getting bigger.
Yes, Bart's a tutor now. Tute on, son! Tute on.
That's fine for you, Marge, but I used to Rock 'N' Roll all night and party everyday. Then, it was every other day. Now, I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a week in which to get funky.
Come on, Maude, the human wang is a beautiful thing.
Dig him up. Dip up that corpse. If you really love Jebediah Springfield, you'll haul his bones out of the ground to prove my daughter wrong.
Don't worry, Marge. America's health care system is second only to Japan, Canada, Sweden, Great Britain, well, all of Europe, but you can thank your lucky stars we don't live in Paraguay!
See you in hell, dinner plate.
Oh, I'll kill myself if Portugal doesn't win.
I don't have to be careful. I've got a gun.
If I didn't have this gun, the King of England could just walk in here any time he wants, and start shoving you around. Do you want that? Huh? Do you?
It seems if a gun can protect something as important as a bar, it's good enough to protect my family.
All right, I have thought this through. I will send Bart the money to fly home, then I will murder him.
Oh, my homemade Kahlua.
But the main thing is: I've finally tapped into that spirit of self-destruction that makes Rock 'N' Roll the king of music.
Please, please, kids, stop fighting. Maybe Lisa's right about America being the land of opportunity, and maybe Adil's got a point about the machinery of capitalism being oiled with the blood of the workers.
Gentlemen, there's only one solution. We place this last donut in the reactor core, exposing it to radiation thereby making it big.
It was a tumultuous time for our nation: the clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live. The information superhighway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about Star Trek. And the domestication of the dog continued unabated.
My marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials. But few stayed to bowl.
Sold. You wrap it up, I'll start bringing in the pennies.
But Marge, valets! Maybe for once, someone will call me "sir" without adding, "You're making a scene.
I'm going to regale everyone with my anecdote. You know, the one I tried to say on the radio? Heh, heh. Who's going to "bleep" me this time?
Ooh, you like sweets, kids? I know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself. In this sweet place, earthly donuts are sour as poison -- you'd spit them out, you would! I'm talking about...the Candy Industry Trade Show! Hee hee.
Why did I take such punishment? Let's just say that fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug was the drugs.
I want to set the record straight. I thought the cop was a prostitute.
Hey, could you take the wheel for a second? I have to scratch myself in two places at once.
Marge, I swear I didn't touch her. You know how bashful I am -- I can't even say the word "titmouse" without giggling like a schoolgirl.
It was the best Thanksgiving ever. I mean- emotionally, it was terrible, but the turkey was so moist.
What!? And violate the code of the schoolyard!? I'd rather Bart die!
The code of the schoolyard, Marge! The rules that teach a boy to be a man. Let's see. Don't tattle. Always make fun of those different from you. Never say anything, unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do.
Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own.
So the next time this bully thinks you're going to throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eye! And then you sock him when he staggers around blinded!
And there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
And if you get the chance, get him right in the family jewels. That little doozy's been a Simpson trademark for generations.
Don't be discouraged, son. I bet Einstein turned himself all sorts of colors before he invented the light bulb.
I'm just saying, why not have two geniuses in the family? Sort of a spare, in case Bart's brain blows up.
When will I learn? The answer to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!
Son, we're in this mess together. No matter how tempting it might be, I can't let my only boy get ripped limb from limb by a bloodthirsty mob.
I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us? Who roller-skate and smoke cigars?
Just a statue? Is the Statue of Liberty just a statue? Is the Leaning Tower of Pizza just a statue?
Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!
Earth-to-Marge. Earth-to-Marge. I was there. The clown is G-I-L-L-T-Y.

Let me explain something to you.  I'm from the old school, you understand.  I'll treat you right.
There ain't nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you, baby.  You know what I mean?
When you and I go out to eat, I'm gunna pull out your chair for you to sit down.  This is a classy maneuver that means I respect you and know how to treat you right.
During our dinner, I'm gonna be whispering in your eat a sweet stream of compliments regarding your exquisite beauty.  "Baby," I'll say, "your lips are like a luscious, red ocean of desire.  And my lips will be like a boat upon that ocean."  And any other variety of compliment.
And when it comes down to making love, I'm going to touch your body like it's never been touched before.  I will remove my hat upon request, because that is the right thing to do.
When I'm making love to you, I will say, "Ooh, sugar... Yeah... Mmm... Mmm-Mmm... Damn..."
Baby, you look so good right now, I wanna get freaky with you right here on this table.
"You are mine," I will say with a warm smile.  Then I will rub your feet for several hours in front of the fire while we listen to Keith Sweat.
You and I will take a bubble bath, and I will rub you from head to toe, every move slow and sophisticated.  I will even remove my ring for the event.
Aw, baby.  Where you going?  Please don't walk out that door.  Don't walk out on Smoove B.  He's the man who can make everything all right.  He's the man who can make love to you all night.
Baby, don't leave me like this.  Let Smoove B put some Klymaxx on the CD player and turn the lights down real low.  I'll put on my crimson silk bathrobe.
Whatever reason you may have for walking out that door, you'll forget about it once I start to shake you down.
There will also be some candles in the bathroom.
Baby, here are just a few of the food items that you remind me of: luscious, chocolate pudding; ripe, red strawberries dipped in whipped cream; succulent, newly picked apricots.
For you, I would charter a special jet to France to purchase a rich, fluffy eclair from the finest eclair establishment in the south of France.  I would deliver it to you at our dinner table on top of a silk pillow.
Aw, baby, I just want to get freaky with you right here on this hardwood floor.  Right now.
There is no room for anything else, because the thought of you takes up all my break.  It's a total Love TKO.
Don't leave me, baby.  I'll caress your hair.
I dream that one day, I will enjoy the privilege and pleasure of grooving you once again.
We will enjoy wine and candlelight, and I will make roast duck or pheasant, or some such meal that is fine.  Only the finest meal is fit for my baby.  There will be gravy also.
Damn, I just want to get freaky with you right now.  Right this second.  Do it to me.
When I am thinking about you, I am thinking about sprinkling the floor of your home with rose petals.  Then I want to put on your favorite Jodeci tape and dance with you real slow.  Then I want to slowly pull your clothes off your smooth, sexy body and move you onto the floor.  Then, I want to get on top of you and love you all night long.
And you know, girl, when Smoove B says he will love you all night long, he means *all* night long.
I will wrap you in satin sheets and hold you.  I will strip for you.
I will not stop pleasing you until the day I die.  I will also give you love during that time.
I still can't believe that you left me.  I was your man.  I was real with you.  Damn.
All I want to say to you is, baby, I'm sorry.  Smoove B never meant to do you like that.
If you would just pick up that phone, I know I could make everything all right.  I would remind you that Smoove B can keep you satisfied all through the night.
If you take me back, I swear I will be the best lover you ever had.  I can take you to the next level.
I would take you to the finest hotel in the city and order room service for us.  We would dine on the finest crab and a side order of carrots, or some such vegetable, cooked to perfection.  We would feed each other in the most romantic fashion.  We would eat ice cream topped with hot fudge, and perhaps sprinkles.
After eating, I would massage you with scented oils from the Orient.  I would reduce your beautiful body to jelly.  You would be so relaxed that nothing else would matter except you and me, and the love we share.  And we would ride together on a caravan of love all night long.
Did I mention we would be listening to Jodeci on the CD player?  We would be.  I guarantee it.
You are my sugar, woman.  Climb up on my saddle, and give it to me good.  Ride my pony until you can't ride no more.
Girl, if you would just pick up the phone and give me the chance to express to you how I feel, I know you would come back into my life.  I would tell you that you are more important to me than the stars in the sky.  You would not believe the places I would touch you if you would just be my girl once more.
Aw, baby, I'm down on my knees.  Please come back to me.  Come back to me so that I can make you the happiest woman in the entire world.
If you just pick up the phone, I would tell you that I want to give you nothing but pleasure all through the night.  I would take you to a level you have never been to before--not with any man, not even with Darnell.
I want to be your man.  Answer the phone, and I will prove my love for you.  Let me freak you.
Girl, if you have any question in your mind as to whether I can satisfy you, bring your body to me now.  Smoove B will satisfy you.
Bring it on to me, and I will love you like nobody can.  I will sex you like nobody can.  I will freak you like nobody can.
I will tell you such things as, "You are the most beautiful woman in the world" and "Your skin is like the most expensive Swiss chocolate money can buy" and "Your eyes are like windows to paradise," and other romantic things that will make you tremble with desire.  I will hit you doggy-style.
All you have to do is tell me what to do and when to stop.  And I promise, you will not want it to stop until the break of dawn.
I will take you higher and higher, to heaven and even further.  We will be love astronauts, colonizing other planets with our passion.  We will bump to Jupiter.  Grind to Pluto.  Damn.
I will cook breakfast for you.  I will fry up serveral eggs, each in a different style for you to choose from.  There will be scarmbled eggs, fried eggs, boiled eggs, baked eggs, and even egg sandwiches.  There will be a smorgasbord of taste sensations for your tender lips to enjoy.
I will then pick a beautiful red rose from outside the bedroom window and put it in an elegant glass vase upon your food tray.  The tray will be only the finest food tray from the far reaches of the earth.  I will also serve cereal.
Aw, please, girl.  Bring your sugar to me, and I will show you that my back is strong.  You will ride me all day and all night and will never want to stop.
Baby, I want your brown sugar right now.  Freak me on my desk right this second.  Give it up to Smoove B.  Take a ride on his Caravan of Love.
I will fulfill your every wish.  And I will use oils if necessary.
So, in conclusion, let me summarize by saying that I will drape you in silk and hit you doggy-style, then I will feed you eggs of every kind and variety, and my back is strong.  Bring it on.
Girl, please allow me to break it down to you.
I would climb to the peak of the highest mountain to demonstrate that my lower-back muscles are powerful and won't give out.
I am the man for you, and I will make you want to get down and get funk-ass nasty with me.  I will make you scream and shout all hours of the night.  I will make sweet love to you like no man has ever before.  In addition to all of that, I will wash you.
I will give you earrings that are more beautiful than a flock of seagulls or some such other type of romantic bird.
You are the lovliest creature in the world, and I promise that I will freak you wild.  We will do the freak in the bed.  We will do the freak on the floor.  We will also do the freak in the bathtub.
There will be bread also.
Woman, I can't stand it.  I want to freak you right here on my desk.  Come here and jump on my saddle right now.
Girl, tell me that you are soaking wet at this stage.  I know that you are.
I want to hold you tight in my arms and swear to you that I will be your man forever.  I want to look deep into your eyes so you will know by the seriousness of my gaze that I will put a sting in you.
You and me, baby.  We will freak like crazy.  Damn.
Girl, if there is any doubt in your mind as to what time it is, let me break it down for you:  It is time to get Smooved.
Aw, baby, I know that I had said some things that made you mad, but I am extremely sorry.  If you just come on home, I will make it up to you.  I will take you to new stratospheres of love.  I will sex you wild.
There will also be a baked potato waiting for you, and some butter for you to place upon that potato.  In addition, there will be sour cream, which you may also put on the potato if you so desire.
Juice will also be served.
It is then that I will hit you doggy-style.
While I am freaking you, I will whisper various things in your ear.  Some of the phrases I will say to you are, "Baby, you are my everything," "You feel so good, I can't stand it," and, "Girl, ride me."  There will also be candles and a CD featuring the music of Keith Sweat to create an atmosphere of unbridled romance, making you wet.
This is how you will get Smooved.
Just say the word, and we will share interplanetary cocoa love until the break of dawn.
We will bump across the galaxy, exploring the known solar system with our passion.  We will journey to places even the astronomers have never been.  We will bump to Pluto, as well as to the moon.
If you wish a grape to be placed in your mouth, I will place one there.  It does not matter whether you want a purple grape or a white grape, as I will supply myself with grapes of both colors.
If you would like to be massaged with scented oils, I will appear behind you and do so.
Aw, girl, I want to throw you on the floor right now and ride you hard.
Just say the word, and I will sting you.  I will Smoove you.  All night long.
I know you have enjoyed being freaked wild by me in the past.  We have made love all night long.  We have been drenched in sweat, bumping and grinding between my satin sheets like wild animals in a heated lust.  We have hit the skins doggy-style.
Let Smoove B orchestrate an evening of romance for you.
We will listen to something with class, such as Anita Baker or Luther, or perhaps my special "Smoove Groove" mix tape.  And I will have candles present to set the mood just right.
I will serve you cooked pheasant with succulent gravy and white wine.  I will serve you hand and foot.  I will serve you on a soft, silk table-cloth that has been freshly laundered and purchased from the finest table-cloth store in all creation.  It will be the most spectacular dinner you have ever consumed.  There will also be corn served.
Baby, I can't stand it.  Straddle me right here, right now.  Let me bring you off nasty.  Damn.
I will caress your entire dark, chocolate body, and I will whisper in your ear various phrases which express how beautiful your body is.  I will say, "Girl, I care for you very deeply.  You have the most beautiful body that has ever been created, and I have got to bag it."
I will put my sting on you, down low.
You know in your heart that it is Smoove B that you want.
I am here to tell you that I will be your man.
When he makes dinner for you, are peas also served?
Follow your heart, baby.  And come back to Smoove.
You are looking very fine.  I am serious.
I will sex you wild.
We will consume a meal at the finest four-star restaurant in the city.  We will be served lobster, oysters, caviar, and cheese.  I will order this meal in French, which will make you wet.  We will be served fine wine, french bread and corn.  It will be a meal for a king and queen.  There will also be cloth napkins.
We will take a ride in a luxurious limousine that contains a TV, all at my expense.  I will provide the $70 necessary for this romantic ride.
I will remove all your clothes, including your bra, your panties, and your socks.  I will take my time and not make a single mistake.
I will lavish kisses upon your body.  Slow and passionate kisses that will seem to last forever and penetrate you deep within your skin.  All the while, I will whisper various things.  "Girl, you are fine," I will say, "Woman, I want you to ride me."
I will stick it in you in the most romantic manner possible.
Girl, I got what you need.  I promise.
Baby, you are the one true love of my life.  You are the one I dream about both night and day.  You are the one who lights the fire of my desire.  Also, you have beautiful facial skin.
Do you desire anything?  Let me know, and I will fulfill that thing.
I will be real.  I will not disappoint you.
You know that no one can freak you like I can.
Girl, I want to take you right now and feel you up from behind.
We will enjoy steak and potatos, and possibly corn.
We will listen to the new CD from Silk, featuring the amazing Darrell "Delite" Allamby.
I will kiss you on the indented area on the underside of your knee, and this will make you scream and shout.  Then I will hit you doggy-style until the break of dawn.
Aw, I want you now, girl.  Set it out for me.
Girl.  Don't make it like that.
It was when I reached your inner thigh that you were driven wild.   You were driven to levels of ecstacy that have been unheard of since the days of Ancient Egypt, the time of Pharaohs and romance.
Damn, girl, simply going over these memories in my mind is making me want you even more.  I want to take you right now, from behind.
Mm.
Say it ain't so, girl.  Say you still want me to be your man.

He's still funny, but not 'ha-ha' funny.
My parents won't let me use scissors.
So, do you...like...stuff?
It says 'I Choo-choo-choose You,' and there's a picture of a train!
The doctor said I wouldn't have so many nose bleeds if I kept my finger outta there.
"What's a battle?

Look, big daddy, it's regular daddy.
Maybe she drove to the moon.
Which one is oral?
No, Miss Hoover, I'm Ralph.

Principal Skinner is an old man who lives at the school.

"You ruined my life, Bill Leeb!"
You bastard, Bill Leeb!
Goddamn you, Leeb...
THE LEEBINATOR, El-Leebo!
Goddamn you, Leeb, you son of a bitch...
Goddamn you, Leeb, you rat bastard son of a bitch...
Damn your black heart, Leeb...
Damn you to hell Leeb, you rotten son of a whore.
The body they found in the bunker was an imposter! He lives still, and is now attempting world domination through shitty music! Yet, like Hitler, Adolph Hitleeb has only one testicle. Stick it up your facist ass, Leeb, you dirty, DIRTY bastard.
"I am Leeb, of the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your samples and synthlines to our own. Your drumloops will act to service us. Resistance, is futile."
This one sort of goes without a silly caption, doesn't it? It's an evil midget Leeb. I feel compelled, however, to say that it would make much more sense to do something Claus Larsen related with Mini-Me, because they are so alike. They even share a common Headvein. No offense, Claus, I know you dig the page. But come on... Mini-Klute.
All right STOP! Collaborate and listen, Leeb is back with a brand new invention, SOMETHING, grabs a hold of me tightly, FLAvour of the Weak sucks daily and nightly, WILL IT EVER STOP? Yo, I don't know. Give me a synth, YO, and I blow. To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal, drive my Sport Utility Vehicle in shorts and sandals, DANCE! Bumrush the speaker that BOOMS, Millenium will make you run for the bathroom, DEADLY, when I steal a dope melody, rippin' off samples commiting copyright felony, love it or leave it, you better gain way, Implode is bullshit, that shit don't play, if there was a drum loop, y0, I stole it, check out the hook, Richard D James wrote it.
"I must confess, that my own lameness, is killing me noooowooohaooowow, don't you know, I am the Leeb. And you will be here, your drumloops are myyyyyaiaiyyyyyn, HIT ME BABY, FROM BEHIND! GUH!"
Bill Leeb brought back Swing Dancing. SON OF A BITCH, LEEB, YOU SON OF A BITCH, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?! Were you DRUNK?! What?! WHAT COULD HAVE POSSIBLY POSSESSED YOU TO COMMIT SUCH HORRIBLE ACTS?! Bastard.
What y'all wanna do? Wanna be ballers? Shot-callers? Brawlers? Who be rippin' off the Chemical Brothers? Stealing beats and humpin' mothers?
I wanna be, the very best, like FLA never was. To steal loops is my real quest, to waste them is my cause. I will tour across the land, cancelling far and wide. My sampler is my only friend, and the Photek loops insiiiiiiide, POKELEEB!
Bill Leeb came to my time, from the future, to protect humanity's last hope. Yeah, that's all well and good, but the fucker shot half my friends, fucked my mom, and messed up my house. Goddamn you, Leeb...
And you thought her fucked up chicken neck was scary! She's alot scarier now that you know her true identy! She is none other than... that guy... from some band... shit, what's his name again? ... RAT BASTARD!
I was letting my apple pie cool down on the windowsill one hot summer day when I thought to myself: "nothing could possibly go wrong!" No... this was wrong! This is totally wrong! It cannot be! You bastard! You sick twisted pie humping, sexually deprived son of a bastard whore!
"With my embrace, I will free them from their personal hell. FLAvour of the Weak is on a permanent loop on the soundsystem of the underworld. *MOURN*
Bill Leeb, or "El-Leebo", as he is known in Spain, went on a violent rampage through my small Spanish village, raping and pillaging. He burnt down my vineyard. Goddamn you, Leeb, you son of a bitch...
Bill Leeb crashed my backyard barbeque, and masturbated in the nude on my picnic table, in front of all my friends and guests. He even splooged in the ground beef. Goddamn you, Leeb, you rat bastard son of a bitch...
Bill Leeb's evil demon spirit magically appeared before me at my computer, and possessed my mortal soul, forcing me to download hundreds of midget porn pics. Damn your black heart, Leeb...
Darth Leeb blew up my home planet with his space station, the LeebStar, cut off my hand with his Leebsabre, and used the force to bang Princess Leia. Damn you to hell Leeb, you rotten son of a whore.
Bill Leeb snuck into the Backstreet Boys by strangling the guy with the big eyebrows, and stealing his snazzy outfit. No one was the wiser. Until he put his evil master plan into effect, and ran around the crowd at the concert, spraypainting FLA on all the little girl's "I LOVE BACKSTREET BOYS" signs. My little sister was in the audience. He touched her booty. Rot in hell Leeb, you rat bastard son of dirty mother whore.
Bill Leeb, disguised as his Quebequois chanteuse alter-ego "Celeeb Dion" nearly took over the world by performing the hit soundtrack to the blockbuster film Titanic, which was based on the nautical disaster that he in fact caused, back when the Titanic left the harbour, by poking holes in the ship's hull with his cyborg penis, and later by attacking it in his Icebergmobile. Damn you Leeb, you smooth-voiced, sensually-curved, heart-string-tugging son of a gutterslut.
Bill Leeb, or "Tupac Shaleeb" as he is known in the ghetto, was cruisin' through my 'hood one day, rollin' in his Impala, sippin' on a 40oz. He pulled a drive-by on my crib in the projects, grabbed my bitch, and straight up put his mack down. He pimp-slapped my momma. Fuck y'all, Leeb, you wack-ass bitch mu'fucka.
