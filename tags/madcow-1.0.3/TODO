FIXME: (blatant bugs, broken stuff)
XXX: (known shortcomings)

*** irc module

- identify with nickserv in irc module (need to test various protocols :/)
- channel or server passwords in irc module

*** modules

- change urban/bbcnew/dictionary match syntax for defintion number. can't look up "area 52" e.g.
- factoids and grufti *always* trigger, which is annoying sometimes. when addressed they should always trigger,
  but when not addressed, only triggering n% of the time would be ideal. or not at all. should be configurable
- priority on modules and/or short-circuiting to prevent match chaining spam
- memebot is missing some features from the original: ability to request a specific score, ability to ignore
  certain urls, the web backend (need to decide on django or turbogears..)
- logging module?
- consider some higher level admin duties such as auto-opping/kickban/etc. eggdrop module? would be nice to
  obsolete having multiple bots, although eggdrops are largely replaced by chanserv/nickserv

*** base class

- add some verbosity. IRC is done, silc seems alright.. AIM needs logging.

TODO: (feature requests)

- ignore list for other bots that might get in a spam war
- authentication for remote admin functions
- option to create a FIFO unix file that you can pipe to to fist madcow.. maybe
- chatroom support for aim/oscar module
- color support ported from insub.pl for higher levels of obnoxiousness
