1. General site styling
2. API key access to keep feeds locked down.. maybe?
3. Fancier browse UI (pagination, filtering)
4. How to extract article summaries reasonably?
5. Run updater periodically
6. publish_date can probably be set to created as long as created >= the last publish_date...
7. why are google reader dates not honoring pubDate? very obnoxious..
