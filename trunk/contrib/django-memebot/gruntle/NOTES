Scanner problems:

1. unicode urls blow up.. guess the path needs to be urlencoded utf-8... 3peen.us
2. localhost needs to be forbidden.. nasty security risk there :O
3. some images don't parse well.. especially it.bo.lt & upload.wikimedia.org.. why not?
4. internal server error on imgur means 404
5. an error_count of 10 is too high.. 3 would probably be Ok


RSS problems:

1. still need to render the pages, not just let it use the link
2. does greader not honor pubDate, or are we doing something wrong?
3. total unicode clusterfuck. not sure if that's my fault. double-check text.py 
4. PyRSS2Gen.py is sort of ghetto.. maybe we should crib its formatting stuff but use lxml

General TODO:

1. General site styling
2. API key access to keep feeds locked down?
3. An RSS index
4. Fancier browse UI (pagination, filtering)
5. A few more feed types
6. How to extract article summaries reasonably?
